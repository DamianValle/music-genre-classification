# Music genre classification

Music genre is a conventional category that identifies pieces of music as belonging to a shared set of conventions. Music classification is subjective and therefore it can be inaccurate and controversial. There are often elements common to a particular genre such as electric guitar and drums for rock or orchestra instruments for classical music. We try to extract the features that characterize the audio and use models that combine them to perform the classification.
